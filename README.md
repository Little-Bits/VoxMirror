Magic Mirror inspired on the raspberry pi

#TODO

* Setup Raspberry Pi Environment for testing
* ~~Can I change Jasper’s name? Sure, you can just replace the “Jasper” name in main.py and musicmode.py.~~ 
* Then, create a new dictionary_persona.dic and languagemodel_persona.lm to include the new name you decide. 
* We recommend the online lmtool to regenerate the dictionary and language model. More information is available here.
